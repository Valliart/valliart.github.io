		<h1>Cats with Carrots</h1>
		<em> As obligate carnivores, cats have specific requirements for their dietary nutrients, namely nutrients found only in meat or synthesized, such as taurine and Vitamin A. This as Carrots are second only to sweet potatoes as an excellent source of beta carotene or vitamin A, cats will benefit from incorporating them in their diet but they also make cute props for photos</em>

	<p> **Please note that some fruits are enemies to cats such as grapes, raisins, lemons, limes and oranges that can give them upset stomachs </p>

	<dl>
	  <dt><strong>Grapes</strong></dt>
	  <dd>-You should never give cat grapes or raisins because of the risk associated with them. They can cause kidney failure which is potentially fatal in dogs, so it is thought that cats could be susceptible too. The exact mechanism of toxicity is unclear, so it is also hard to know exactly how many grapes will cause toxicity. </dd>
	  <dt><strong>Lemons, lines and oranges</strong></dt>
	  <dd>- Cats will usually avoid lemons and limes because of their strong citrus flavor. The flesh of these fruits is non-toxic but when eaten in large quantities can irritate a catâ€™s stomach and intestines. The skin of lemons and limes, their seeds, and the tree on which it grows however contains some toxic compounds which could be harmful, including a phototoxic chemical called psoralens plus some essential oils. Vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and potential skin issues could occur. </dd>
