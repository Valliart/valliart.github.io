		<h1>Cats with Carrots</h1>
		<em> As obligate carnivores, cats have specific requirements for their dietary nutrients, namely nutrients found only in meat or synthesized, such as taurine and Vitamin A. This as Carrots are second only to sweet potatoes as an excellent source of beta carotene or vitamin A, cats will benefit from incorporating them in their diet but they also make cute props for photos</em>
